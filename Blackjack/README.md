## ✨ Features
- **Fixed Dealer Rules**: Unlike players who can choose their moves, the dealer is strictly bound by house rules, typically requiring them to "hit" until their hand reaches at least 17 and "stand" thereafter.

- **Flexible Ace Value**: The Ace is the most versatile card, as it can be counted as either 1 or 11 points depending on which value most benefits the player's current hand.
