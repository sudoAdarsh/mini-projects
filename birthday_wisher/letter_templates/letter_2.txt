Hi [NAME],

Wishing you a very Happy Birthday! I hope this year brings you happiness, success, and fewer “Why am I still awake?” nights.

May your cake be sweet, your WiFi be strong, and your day be filled with the people and things you love most.

Enjoy your special day to the fullest—you’ve earned it!
