Hi [NAME],

Happy Birthday! I’m really hoping your day is filled with the people, memories, and moments that make your heart feel full.

You deserve all the good things—peace, happiness, growth, and laughs that make your stomach hurt.
May this year bring you closer to your dreams and farther from unnecessary stress.

Enjoy your day, celebrate yourself, and keep being amazing.
